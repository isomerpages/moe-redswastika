# Health Matters
**Haze Management**

We will monitor the haze situation and take appropriate mitigation measures based on MOH’s health advisory for the day to ensure the well-being of our students and staff. For updates on the haze situation, visit NEA website www.nea.gov.sg, the haze microsite www.haze.gov.sg, follow NEA Facebook www.facebook.com/NEASingapore and NEA Twitter (@NEAsg), or download the myENV app. Please check the school website for updates. If your child/ward has a pre-existing condition, do remind him/her to have the medication with him/her daily (e.g. an inhaler for asthma).


**Zika and Dengue Management**

To minimise the risk of further spread of Zika and Dengue in Singapore, it is critical that all of us, as a community, take active steps to prevent mosquito breeding. We have taken steps to prevent mosquito breeding in school by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout and fuming. You can take additional precautions to protect your child/ward against mosquito bites by getting him/her to apply insect repellent regularly. Let’s play our part in ensuring that our homes do not breed mosquitoes too.

**Social Responsibility**

We seek your cooperation to reinforce the importance of personal hygiene to your child/ward. If your child/ward is unwell, please advise him/her to stay home and seek medical attention immediately. Do allow your child to rest at home for the full duration of the MC and return to school only when he/she is well. For illnesses that are contagious (e.g. HFMD, chicken pox), do inform your child/ward’s Form Teachers as soon as possible and ensure that he/she has fully recovered before returning to school.


**Medical Attention**

Should your child/ward fall ill during the school day, you will be informed to pick him/her up. In an emergency that requires treatment in the hospital, we will call for an ambulance and keep you informed.

As advised by Health Promotion Board, first aid kit should not contain oral medications or any other forms of topical medications (e.g. antiseptic cream, mopiko, zam-buk, ointment etc.) in view of possible allergic reactions. As such, the school will not administer any oral or topical medication.
