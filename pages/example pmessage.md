<h1><strong>Title - 校长致辞 Principal's Message</strong></h1>
<p><strong>/about-rss/principals-message/</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>From the Principal’s Desk</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome to Red Swastika School!</p>
<p>Red Swastika School was founded by the World Red Swastika Society in 1951
as an extension of its charitable mandate and to achieve the objective
of transforming people through education. Over the many years of the school’s
establishment, RSS has grown from strength to strength in its journey to
educate her students.</p>
<p>At the heart of Red Swastika School is our student whom we affectionately
call a 卍慈的孩子. We envision our students to be members of a caring community
who are also innovative leaders. Our school motto, ‘恭宽信敏’, encapsulates
our belief that every RSS student can become an individual who exemplifies
graciousness (恭), magnanimity (宽), trustworthiness (信) and diligence (敏).
We aspire for our students to grow into persons with exemplary character
and who are joyful learners.</p>
<p>卍慈的孩子是特选的孩子。 As a Special Assistance Plan School, we nurture students
who are not only effectively bilingual but also having a good understanding
of the Chinese culture. We want our students to appreciate cultural diversity
and work towards building a harmonious society.</p>
<p>卍慈的孩子也是“三小” – 小主人, 小朋友和小先生。 As a 小主人 (Little Master), an RSS student is
a self-directed and independent learner who demonstrates resilience and
responsibility even in the face of challenges. In the role of a 小朋友 (Little
Friend), an RSS student knows how to care for others and build harmonious
relationships through respect and courtesy. Being a 小先生 (Little Teacher),
an RSS student thinks about how to make life better for others and always
reaches out to contribute to the school and community.</p>
<p>In growing our 卍慈的孩子, we are greatly blessed to have the strong support
of our various stakeholders and partners. Together, we have been working
closely over the many years to work towards realizing our vision of ‘Caring
Community, Innovative Leaders’.</p>
<p>At Red Swastika School, we are proud of our heritage and our RSS story.
We hope that you will also gain a better understanding of our school through
your viewing of our school website.</p>
