**Founder’s Day**

To celebrate this momentous milestone of our growth, the school has lined up a series of activities since the start of the year. The celebration was kicked off on Founder’s Day on 13 January with the unveiling of the theme and the event logo to our staff, students and stakeholders. The climax of the 70th Founder’s Day was the presentation of the commemorative video, showing footages of our staff and students, past and present, and those of the old school premises. That day, our staff, students, alumni and partners beamed with pride as we reminisced our growth and achievements as a school.

**Our Family Storybook**

This birthday celebration will not be complete without telling a story about our people and the journey we have travelled. We are producing a commemorative book, yes, a Coffee-table book that will tell a warm story about our RSS family history, quests and dreams. This ‘family storybook’ is about our beliefs, defining moments, special people, memorable spaces, progress and achievements, everything that defines our growth from the beginning at Somapah Road to now, where we are, at Bedok North Street 3.

**Integration of the 70th Celebration into Our Curriculum**

In addition to all the above-mentioned initiatives, the school has also integrated our anniversary celebration creatively into the curriculum through the implementation of engaging and meaningful learning activities. We hope these enjoyable activities will enable our staff and students to learn so much more about RSS and appreciate the school for who we are and what we can achieve.
