The school values parents/guardians as co-partners in educating our students. We communicate with parents via:

* Student Handbook
* Website
* Emails <p>(Click [here](/about-rss/our-people) for our staff's email addresses)
* Phone Calls
* Letters to Parents through Parent Gateway
* Parents Conferences <p>(Click [here](/parents-conferences) for more information)
* Parent-Child-Teacher Conference


For any school-related matters, please approach your child’s Form Teachers as the first point of contact via email or phone call. 

If you wish to speak with your child’s/ward’s teacher, you may leave your contact number with the General Office and your child’s/ward’s teacher will contact you as soon as possible. We seek your understanding that communication with teachers/staff should only take place between 7.30am and 5pm on working days, unless for emergency cases. Teachers are not required to share their personal mobile phone numbers with parents. If a face-to-face meeting with any teacher is required, parents/guardians should make a prior appointment with the teachers.

To instil the value of responsibility in our students, we will not facilitate the handing over of any student's work/item or passing of pocket money via the General Office. Students are to record instructions of work assigned from the Class Homework Whiteboard into their handbooks. Parents/Guardians are advised to remind their children/wards to bring their learning materials and homework assignments to school each day.


**Updating of Contact Details**

To facilitate communication, it is important for the school to maintain an updated list of the main point-of-contact and the contact details of parents/guardians for our students. If there is a change in the main point-of-contact and/or the contact details of the parents/guardians for our students, please update the school promptly even if it is only for a temporary period. You may send the updates to your child’s/ward’s Form Teachers via email.
