<p><strong>Key Programmes / Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Physical education (PE) is an integral part of the school curriculum.
It provides students with the opportunities to acquire the knowledge and
skills that lead to a lifelong pursuit of active and healthy lifestyle,
and provide the foundation for students who wish to pursue physical sports
at a higher level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recognising that every child has a different physical ability and interest
in physical activities, the Department uses a two-tier approach to provide
different depth of experience for our students in Physical Education:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tier 1: Broad-based exposure and development of physical competencies
through mass participation at a recreational level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tier 2: Specialized training for those with interest and ability to participate
at a higher level through Co-Curricular activities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With a tiered approach, every child is enabled to enjoy physical activities
at the level of participation they most prefer. They can choose to participate
recreationally or competitively, thus contributing to the joy of learning
and motivating them towards lifelong participation in physical activities.</p>
<p>At the primary school level, students learn the fundamental movement skills
incorporating the movement concepts. They develop efficiency, effectiveness
and versatility in their performance as they practise and transfer their
skills across the three learning areas of PE (Physical Activity, Outdoor
Education and Physical Health and Safety) to become competent movers.</p>
