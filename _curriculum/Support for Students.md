**Edusave Pupils Fund**

Your child will receive an annual contribution in his/her Edusave account, if he/she is a Singaporean. The amount contributed is $230, as of 2019. Your child may use the funds in his/her Edusave account to pay for the second-tier miscellaneous fees (for GIRO only) and enrichment programmes organised by the school.

**Financial Assistance Scheme**

Financial assistance scheme is available to ensure that no child is left behind because of his financial situation. The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) provides needy Singaporean students with free textbooks, school attire, school meal subsidy, transport subsidy and waiver of school fees and standard miscellaneous fees. Parents can approach the school directly if financial assistance is required. There is also school-based assistance to benefit those who do not meet the qualifying criteria for the MOE FAS.
