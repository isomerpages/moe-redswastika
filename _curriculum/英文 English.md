<h1>Our Objectives</h1>
<p>At RSS, we aim to nurture confident and effective communicators as well
as critical thinkers who are able to use the English Language to deepen
their insights, connect with others effectively and contribute to the community.</p>
<h1>Our Key Programmes/Activities</h1>
<p>Oracy Programmes</p>
<p><strong>Effective Communication Programme (ECP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students hone their communication skills on a variety of platforms.
Through the different level activities, they learn to communicate confidently
and effectively with a range of audience. They also learn to work collaboratively
with their peers and use feedback provided by their teachers and peers
to improve on their presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 1: Show and Tell</strong>
</p>
<p>The P1 students are guided to prepare a speech on a given topic within
their knowledge and experience and present it to their teachers and classmates.
This activity not only enables students to hone their public speaking and
basic writing skills, but it also provides a meaningful platform for teachers
and students to bond as they get to know one another better.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 2: Pick and Tell</strong>
</p>
<p>This activity extends the learning gleaned by the students when they were
in P1. The P2 students pick an item from a collection before they are guided
to prepare and present a speech in relation to the chosen item. Through
this activity, the students learn to generate ideas creatively and they
continue to hone their public speaking and writing skills.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 3 &amp; Primary 4: Readers’ Theatre</strong>
</p>
<p>The P3 &amp; P4 students perform a Readers’ Theatre for their teachers
and classmates based on a script of their choice. They work collaboratively
as a team to “act out” the different roles in a story by reading in an
expressive manner, using effective vocal cues. Through this activity, the
students learn effective dramatization skills and continue to build their
confidence in engaging an audience.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 5: Debate</strong>
</p>
<p>Using debates in the classroom provide students the opportunity to work
in a collaborative and cooperative group setting. The students get the
opportunity to discuss and organize their points of view for one side of
an argument as they discover new information and put knowledge into action.
Classroom debates also help students learn through friendly competition,
examine controversial topics as well as strengthen their skills in the
areas of leadership, communication, problem solving and presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 6: Podcast</strong>
</p>
<p>Our P6 students will find that producing a podcast is a great way for
them to develop their oral and creative writing skills. As they plan and
structure their podcast, write and edit their scripts as well as record
and edit their audio, the students will be able to express their ideas
in a unique and creative way which is also a favourable avenue with the
current times.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Writing Programmes</p>
<p><strong>Use of Mentor Texts</strong>
</p>
<p>We adopt the ‘I Do-We Do-You Do’ model in teaching writing. In Primary
3 and 4, students read and emulate mentor texts that serve as models of
good writing.</p>
<p><em>I Do:</em>
</p>
<p>Based on the learning focus of a lesson, the teacher introduces a mentor
text to teach ideas, structures and/or specific writing skills.</p>
<p><em>We Do:</em>
</p>
<p>Guided practices are designed for students to test drive and apply what
they have learnt from a mentor text. The activities are conducted in pairs
or in a group to encourage collaborative learning.</p>
<p><em>You Do:</em>
</p>
<p>Students are engaged in independent writing where they apply what they
have learnt to their own writing.</p>
<p><strong>Process Writing</strong>
</p>
<p>From Primary 3 to Primary 6, the students are engaged in process writing
where each writing task is broken down into its smaller components. The
students are guided to complete each component sequentially, and this helps
make writing a more enjoyable task for many students. The students also
learn that writing has to be planned, and it will evolve as it develops
and takes shape. Process Writing consists of two major and interdependent
phases: the prewriting phase and the writing phase. Prewriting helps writers
to organize, sequence, and elaborate on their ideas prior to writing. The
writing phase turns this organisation of ideas into a composition.</p>

<p>&gt; Reading Programmes</p>
<p><strong>EL/CL Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In collaboration with the CL department, My Book Recommendations, a booklet
consisting of activities to promote reading, is given to each student.
The booklets are customised for each level to cater to the needs of different
reading ages. Both teachers and students are engaged in the activities,
thus encouraging everyone @RSS to read widely. An example of an activity
in the booklet is the Reading Bingo where students are engaged in various
ways to pique their interest in EL and CL books.</p>
<p><strong>Visits to RSS Library</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are taken to the school library regularly where they are introduced
to the different genres available. Through various library programmes,
in-house or in collaboration with the National Library Board, the students
are engaged in different activities that deepen their reading interest.
Thematic book displays are also put up regularly to introduce students
to the wide variety of good books in the library.</p>
<p><strong>In-curriculum Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme, as a part of the STELLAR Programme (as shown under MOE
Programmes), aims to inculcate the love for reading in children. Comprising
the Shared Book Approach in Primary 1 and Primary 2 and Supported Reading
in Primary 3 to Primary 6, the programme is carried out regularly in class.
In addition, there is also the Extensive Reading Programme where ‘book
floods’ are made available in all EL classrooms – students borrow books
from a flood (a huge supply) of books and get to read new books when their
classes’ books are exchanged with others’.</p>
<p>Through the above activities, RSS students discover the joy of reading
and open themselves up to a world beyond their imagination.</p>

<p><u>RSS Reads!</u>
<br>RSS Reads! is a termly event organized by both the English and Chinese
Language departments with the main objective of deepening the students’
love in reading. Every term, the students will be presented with a different
theme – a way in which the joy in reading can be cultivated and translated
into actions. We look forward to seeing how our students can materialise
their love for reading through the different termly themes.</p>
<p><u>Term 1:</u>
<br>The theme for term 1 was ‘Superheroes’. Staff and students came dressed
as their favourite hero from a book/real-life event that inspired them.
Some also brought along a prop that represented their chosen hero. The
students also brough the book related to their chosen hero as they were
given the opportunity to read about it in class and share their ‘hero’
stories with their peers and teachers.</p>

<p>&gt; MOE Programmes</p>
<p><strong>STELLAR Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) aims to
foster a love for reading and a strong foundation in the receptive and
productive skills. The STELLAR programme is built on the belief that enjoyment
is a fundamental aspect of all positive reading and writing experiences.</p>
