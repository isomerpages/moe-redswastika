# Our Objectives

At RSS, we aim to nurture confident and effective communicators as well as critical thinkers who are able to use the English Language to deepen their insights, connect with others effectively and contribute to the community.

# Our Key Programmes/Activities

***Oracy Programmes***

**Effective Communication Programme (ECP)**

Our students hone their communication skills on a variety of platforms. Through the different level activities, they learn to communicate confidently and effectively with a range of audience. They also learn to work collaboratively with their peers and use feedback provided by their teachers and peers to improve on their presentation.

**Primary 1: Show and Tell**

The P1 students are guided to prepare a speech on a given topic within their knowledge and experience and present it to their teachers and classmates. This activity not only enables students to hone their public speaking and basic writing skills, but it also provides a meaningful platform for teachers and students to bond as they get to know one another  better.


**Primary 2: Pick and Tell**

This activity extends the learning gleaned by the students when they were in P1. The P2 students pick an item from a collection before they are guided to prepare and present a speech in relation to the chosen item. Through this activity, the students learn to generate ideas creatively and they continue to hone their public speaking and writing skills.

**Primary 3 & Primary 4: Readers’ Theatre**

The P3 & P4 students perform a Readers’ Theatre for their teachers and classmates based on a script of their choice. They work collaboratively as a team to “act out” the different roles in a story by reading in an expressive manner, using effective vocal cues. Through this activity, the students learn effective dramatization skills and continue to build their confidence in engaging an audience.


**Primary 5 & Primary 6: Reading Aloud and Stimulus-Based Conversations**

Students are progressively guided from P1 to P6 to develop their reading and conversational skills. The consolidation and application of learning culminates in P5 and P6 where students learn to engage their audience through i) accurate, fluent and expressive reading; and ii) well-developed and interesting contents.

***Writing Programmes***

**Use of Mentor Texts**

We adopt the ‘I Do-We Do-You Do’ model in teaching writing. In Primary 3 and 4, students read and emulate mentor texts that serve as models of good writing. 

*I Do:*  

Based on the learning focus of a lesson, the teacher introduces a mentor text to teach ideas, structures and/or specific writing skills.

*We Do:* 

Guided practices are designed for students to test drive and apply what they have learnt from a mentor text.  The activities are conducted in pairs or in a group to encourage collaborative learning.

*You Do:* 

Students are engaged in independent writing where they apply what they have learnt to their own writing. 


Process Writing
From Primary 3 to Primary 6, the students are engaged in process writing where each writing task is broken down into its smaller components. The students are guided to complete each component sequentially, and this helps make writing a more enjoyable task for many students. The students also learn that writing has to be planned, and it will evolve as it develops and takes shape. Process Writing consists of two major and interdependent phases: the prewriting phase and the writing phase. Prewriting helps writers to organize, sequence, and elaborate on their ideas prior to writing. The writing phase turns this organisation of ideas into a composition.
