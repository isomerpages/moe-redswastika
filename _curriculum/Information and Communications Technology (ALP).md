**Our Objectives**

Through the use of information and communications technology, we aim to develop future-ready and responsible digital learners who are rooted in sound values, equipped with essential knowledge and skills, and committed to giving back to the community.

**Our Key Programmes / Activities**

**e-Pedagogy**

This is the practice of teaching with technology for active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner. Guided by e-Pedagogy, our teachers design differentiated learning experiences that enhance student engagement, enable subject mastery and develop 21st Century Competencies in our students. Through well-designed learning experiences, we aim to develop our students as self-directed learners who enjoy the joy of learning.

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Tinkers to Thinkers**

As the Chinese saying goes, “学无止境” — learning never stops and we should learn for life. In line with this belief, our ALP, Tinkers to Thinkers, aims to nurture the joy of learning in our students by creating an exciting but safe learning environment for them to tinker, explore, innovate, and grow.

We believe that a child who tinkers is constantly involved in the thinking process. Our ALP provides students with the opportunities to tinker with block-based coding. Through such learning experiences, they develop computational thinking. 21st Century Competencies and also attain greater awareness of how coding and technology can be used in the real world. They are challenged to create solutions to real world problems, with the use of coding and technology.

Our Tier 1 programme is designed to expose all students to coding through 3 different stages:
* Stage 1 - Imagine through PLAY
* Stage 2 - Ignite the PASSION
* Stage 3 - Innovate with PURPOSE

Our Tier 2 Programme is for students who have a strong interest in coding. They are invited to join the Robotics Club where they continue to hone their skills in coding. Students are also given opportunities to participate in various competitions where they are challenged to solve problems by applying the knowledge and skills acquired.
