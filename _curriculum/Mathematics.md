**Key Programmes / Activities**

Learning Mathematics is more than just learning concepts. Equally important are the cognitive and metacognitive process skills. These skills are developed in our students through a variety of learning experiences, including the use of technological aids that help them make sense of the various mathematical ideas and their applications to daily lives. Making learning experiences meaningful and relevant go a long way in promoting the joy of learning in Mathematics and nurturing our students to be confident and creative problem solvers.

**Factual Fluency (P1 to P6)**

Time is set aside in every Mathematics lesson to help our students recall basic numeracy facts so as to develop their factual fluency in Mathematics. Factual fluency aims to help our students ease their cognitive load when learning new Mathematics concepts.

**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach (P1 to P6)**

To help students develop a deep and sustainable understanding of Mathematics, our teachers use the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach to introduce concepts in a concrete and tangible way that builds on students’ existing knowledge. Through the skillful use of manipulatives, students develop the mental connections between the concrete, pictorial, and abstract phases, which help them build a strong foundation in the conceptual understanding of Mathematics.

**Problem Solving with Heuristics and Differentiating Instruction in Mathematics (P1 to P6)**

Heuristics skills are introduced progressively to help our students develop competencies in problem solving. Together with Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques, questions are designed to help our students develop essential thinking routines when solving mathematics problems. To cater to the diverse learning needs of our students, open-ended parallel questions are used to allow students to explore questions with the same learning content but at different levels of difficulty. Students can choose to attempt questions at the level of difficulty that allows them to stretch their thinking and deepen their understanding.

**Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme (P1 and P2)**

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention programme to provide support for selected students who have yet to develop the foundational numeracy skills to cope with the P1 and P2 Mathematics curriculum. Through hands-on activities that are specially designed for their learning needs, students develop mastery of basic numeracy skills and build their confidence in the learning of Mathematics.

**Developing the potential of our students through Enrichment Activities**

To develop the potential of our students, the Department organizes enrichment programmes and activities for students with interests and aptitude in Mathematics. These include Mathematics Competitions as well as the E2K Mathematics Programme.

The E2K Mathematics Programme is offered to selected P4 and P5 students to develop their mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. The programme also allows our students to:

* Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions that Mathematicians need to possess; and
* Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.


Students have the opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers, and engage in mathematical thinking through resources specially designed for this programme.
