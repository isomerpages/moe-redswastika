**Key Programmes / Activities**

Children are naturally curious and they learn through exploring things around them. Hence, the Science Department promotes the joy of learning in Science by stimulating our studentsâ€™ curiosity about their environment.

**Inquiry-based Learning**

An inquiry-based learning approach is used to help students make connections of the scientific concepts with their daily lives and their environment. Through these carefully constructed learning experiences, our students develop the skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry and making personal decisions. To cater to the diverse learning needs of our students, the Department uses Differentiated Instruction to allow students to demonstrate their learning through varied ways so as to promote the joy of learning.
