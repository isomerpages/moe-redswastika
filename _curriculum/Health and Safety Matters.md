# Health Matters
**Haze Management**

We will monitor the haze situation and take appropriate mitigation measures based on MOH’s health advisory for the day to ensure the well-being of our students and staff. For updates on the haze situation, visit NEA website (www.nea.gov.sg), the haze microsite (www.haze.gov.sg), follow NEA Facebook (www.facebook.com/NEASingapore) and NEA Twitter (@NEAsg), or download the myENV app. Please check the school website for updates. If your child has a pre-existing condition, do remind him/her to have the medication with him/her daily (e.g. child with asthma to carry the inhaler etc.).

**Zika and Dengue Management**

To minimise the risk of further spread of Zika and Dengue in Singapore, it is critical that all of us, as a community, take active steps to prevent mosquito breeding. We have taken steps to prevent mosquito breeding in school by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout and fuming. You can take additional precautions to protect your children against mosquito bites by getting them to apply insect repellent regularly. Let’s play our part in ensuring that our homes do not breed mosquitoes too.

**Social Responsibility**

We seek your cooperation to reinforce the importance of personal hygiene to your child. Should your child feel unwell, please bring him/her to see a doctor and let him/her rest at home. He/She should only return to school when he/she is well.

For infectious illness such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD), please consult a doctor and receive a memo to certify that your child is fit for school before his/her return to school.

**Medical Attention**

Should your child fall ill during the school day, you will be informed to pick him/her up. In an emergency that requires treatment in the hospital, we will call the ambulance and keep you informed.

As advised by Health Promotion Board, first aid kit should not contain oral medications or any other forms of topical medications (e.g. antiseptic cream, mopiko, zam-buk, ointment etc) in view of possible allergic reactions. As such, the school will not administer any oral medications and provide topical medication.
