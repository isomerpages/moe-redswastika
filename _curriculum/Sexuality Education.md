# MOE Sexuality Education in Schools


1.
Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.


2.
The goals of Sexuality Education are:
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(i) To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate *knowledge* on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>      
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(ii)       To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of *social and emotional skills* of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(iii)       To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of *positive mainstream values and attitudes* about sexuality.</p>



3.
The key messages of Sexuality Education are:
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(i)            Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(ii)          Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(iii)         Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(iv)     Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

# Overview of RED SWASTIKA’S Sexuality Education Programme for 2022

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a.       Science</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">b.       Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</p>

**Sexuality Education**: “Curious Minds (2nd Edition)” (Primary 5 & 6) Teaching & Learning resource package

6.
The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty.  With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. “Curious Minds” is a response to these challenges.

7.
The Primary 5 & 6 Sexuality Education Teaching and Learning resource package, “Curious Minds (2nd Edition)”, aims to meet students’ developmental needs, give emphasis to the teaching of skills and values, and focus on helping students navigate *changes*, build healthy *relationships*, especially online relationships, and exercise *safety*.
