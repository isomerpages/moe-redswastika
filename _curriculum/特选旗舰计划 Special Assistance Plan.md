**Tier 1:**
<br>All students participate in broad-based SAP programmes comprising SAP assemblies, recess activities and intra-school learning activities. These activities are designed to deepen students’ appreciation of the Chinese Language,  Chinese culture, local and global cultures and customs.
<br>在卍慈，我们希望通过艺术的熏陶，让学生多接触中华文化和本土文化，并为学生开拓视野，帮助他们更广泛地了解世界和不同的文化传统。因此学校每年会庆祝农历新年、端午节和中秋节，还会主办不同类型的中华文化周会和活动。这些活动和表演形式多样化，包含戏剧、相声、华族舞蹈、木头剧、华乐、京剧、游戏、展览等等。每一场活动和演出加深学生的印象，并且让他们从中学习更多的中华文化的知识。

<br>Customised level-specific SAP enrichment programmes are designed and implemented using a thematic approach for each level. Students are engaged in class activities to learn about Chinese and other local cultures. 
<br>在卍慈，学生都会在六年的特选文化课程中接触不同的中华文学和历史。除了华文部门的老师们尽心尽力地设计有趣的文化课，并且亲自授课，学校也聘请商家主办以“琴、棋、书、画”为主题的特选增益活动，让文化课程变得更多姿多彩、丰富有趣。
