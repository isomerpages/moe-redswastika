<p><strong>Key Programmes / Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) at RSS provide students with a platform
to discover their interests and develop their talents. CCA can fuel in
students a life-long passion for a particular activity and guide them in
their pursuit of a balanced life in adulthood. The CCA experiences curated
by the teachers are designed to engage students and develop them holistically
in their chosen area of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Outcomes of CCA</strong>
