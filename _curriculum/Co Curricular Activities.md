**Key Programmes / Activities**

The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) at RSS provide students with a platform to discover their interests and develop their talents. CCA can fuel in students a life-long love for a particular activity and guide them in their pursuit of a balanced life in adulthood. The CCA experiences curated by the teachers are designed to engage students and develop them holistically in their chosen area of interest.

**Learning Outcomes of CCA**

CCAs enable every child to develop and demonstrate:
* passion;
* leadership & teamwork;
* friendship & belonging;
* spirit of service to the community;
* knowledge, skills and values related to their choice of CCA; and
* core values, social and emotional competencies and 21st century competencies.

**CCA Programme**

Students are strongly encouraged to participate in a CCA from Primary 3 onwards. We provide students with CCA choices to cater to their different interests and talents. These are broadly categorized into the following four categories:

**Co-Curriculum Enrichment**

To complement the CCA programme, the school started the P1 to P5 Co-Curriculum Enrichment since 2020 to provide an additional platform for students to discover their interests and talents in the various CCA categories.
