<p><strong>Key Programmes / Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Children are naturally curious and they learn through exploring things
around them. Hence, the Science Department promotes the joy of learning
in Science by stimulating our students’ curiosity about their environment.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>An inquiry-based learning approach is used to help students make connections
of the scientific concepts with their daily lives and their environment.
Through these carefully constructed learning experiences, our students
develop the skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific
inquiry and making personal decisions. To cater to the diverse learning
needs of our students, the Department uses Differentiated Instruction to
allow students to demonstrate their learning through varied ways so as
to promote the joy of learning.</p>
