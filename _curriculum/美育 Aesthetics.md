<p><strong>Key Programmes / Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>The Aesthetics Department is committed to nurturing our students to be
joyful learners through our Art and Music Programmes. Our Art and Music
programmes provide ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression
and equip our students with the knowledge and skills that promote a lifelong
enjoyment and appreciation of the Arts.</p>

<p><strong>Art Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Art Programme in RSS provides students with opportunities to explore
and experiment with a variety of media and tools. Students are exposed
to a multitude of art forms such as 2D, 3D, digital and traditional artworks.
In P1 and P2, students are first exposed to a wide variety of mediums to
pique their curiosity and stimulate their creativity in Art. When students
reach P3, they will gain an exposure to different art styles and techniques
to express themselves. As they move up to P4, students will have the opportunity
to visit a local Art gallery as part of the Museum-based Learning (MBL)
module. This enables them to cultivate museum etiquette and appreciate
local artists and their artworks. At P5 and P6, students will have the
chance to explore new media through the utilization of digital technology.</p>

<p>In addition to art practices, the Art programme in RSS also comprises
cultural experiences. To achieve the school’s goal of nurturing bilingual
and bi-cultural students with a global outlook, the Art programme in RSS
is specially designed to provide students with a rich and broad understanding
and experience of the various cultures in the local and global contexts.
The Mother-Tongue Language Fortnight (MTLF) Art programme is an example
of a programme that aims to deepen students’ understanding and appreciation
of the Chinese culture. Through these rich and varied learning experiences,
our students enjoy art, learn to communicate visually and make meaning
through connecting with society and culture.</p>

<p>The Music Programme also ensures that students’ learning is deepened through
the progression of musical knowledge and skills, such as the Recorder Programme
at P3 and P4, and the Ukulele Programme at P4 and P5. In addition, students
are given the opportunities to develop their ability in creative composition
and expression, such as the P4 GarageBand Programme. Students are also
encouraged to showcase their music talents through our RSS Musical Buskers
and RSS Got Talent programmes. Through these rich learning experiences,
students learn to appreciate music from different cultures in the local
and global contexts, and develop the ability for creative expression and
communication through music, thus motivating them towards a lifelong enjoyment
of music.</p>
