The Red Swastika School Alumni Association was formed in August 1998 with the mission to connect the School and the Alumni. Once a Swastikian, forever a Swastikian (一日卍慈人，一生卍慈情) – this sums up our belief that there will always be a part of RSS in every student and staff.

The association aims to promote friendship and foster camaraderie amongst alumni of all ages, in the hope that alumni from different generations will stay united in our mission to contribute to the school and the community.

Alumni who are interested to join RSSAA may download the [RSSAA Application Form](https://bit.ly/3FhoDB7) and submit it via email.
