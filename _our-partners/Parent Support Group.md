RSS Parent Support Group (PSG) was set up in March 2015. We have since grown in strength and size and our main aim is to create a platform for parents to support the school and one another.

For more information, please visit our official facebook page (@RSSPSG).

We invite all parents who are interested to be part of the RSS PSG family to drop us an email at [rsspsg@gmail.com](mailto:rsspsg@gmail.com).

Yours sincerely,
<br>Cheng Ying Ling (Ms)
<br>Chairperson
