Dear Parents,

(Please note that applications received after the stipulated closing date will be rejected)

 Eligibility: Applicable for children born between 2 Jan 2018 to 1 Jan 2019 (both dates inclusive) only
 
 1. The school reviews and selects applicants during the 2nd quarter of each year (the year prior to the P1 Registration Exercise).

Parents may apply to volunteer their service at more than one school. You would need to check with the schools concerned about the application procedures.

2. The school is looking for a long-term partnership with our stakeholders. Should you be selected, we seek your understanding to continue to support the school even if you have fulfilled the minimum requirement of 40 voluntary hours in the event that the school requires your continued assistance.

3. Parents who are accepted as Parent Volunteers will start contributing their voluntary hours one year before the start of the Primary One Registration Exercise. Kindly note that activities are conducted during school hours.

4. Parent volunteers are responsible for the completion of 40 hours of voluntary work to be eligible for Phase 2B of the Primary One Registration Exercise. Should the number of Phase 2B applications exceed the number of places available for this phase, MOE will conduct a centralised balloting. Singapore citizens will be admitted first ahead of PRs, before home-school distance is considered.
