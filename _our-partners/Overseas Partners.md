# Chinese Ambassadors-in-Residence (CLARs) 驻校中华文化大使

Since 2010, RSS has recognised the Vice-Principals or Senior Chinese Teachers from our overseas collaborating schools as our Chinese Ambassadors-in-Residence (CLARs) and has been hosting them yearly. The CLARs are from Nanjing Xing Zhi Primary School, Chengdu Caotang Primary School and Chengdu Experimental Primary School. The CLARs have been conducting school-based Chinese Culture lessons for our P1 to P6 students using lesson resources and packages designed by RSS SAP committee. With their vast knowledge and experiences of the topics, the CLARs have enriched our students’ learning. The month-long stay of CLARs is always planned such that it coincides with the school’s Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, wherever possible. During their stay in Singapore, the CLARs conduct story-telling sessions during recesses as part of the MTL Fortnight programme. They also share their experiences and exchanged ideas on teaching approaches and pedagogies with RSS Chinese teachers during Learning Circles, the school professional learning session for staff.

从2010年开始，每一年，我校都会邀请海外伙伴学校的教师前来成为我校的“驻校中华文化大使”。中华文化大使留新期间，为我校学生授课，进行文化交流。中华文化大使上课内容包含我校特选中华文化校本课程和中国当地文化课程。除了文化课，中华文化大使也参与华文教师学习圈。两校华文教师进行课堂教学的探究与分享。这提供了教师们互相学习的平台。中华文化大使也会参与本校母语双周的庆祝活动。
