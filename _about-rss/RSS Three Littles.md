Values inculcation has been done uniquely in RSS through aligning the school values to the Three Littles. This approach is drawn from the Xingzhi education philosophy. The Little Friend, Little Master and Little Teacher personify values that are relatable and relevant to the students.

# Little Friend

As a diligent and joyful learner, a Little Master takes ownership of his own learning. He displays self-discipline and is responsible for his words and actions towards building a culture of care. He is committed to self-improvement. Being resilient and alert in responding to changes, he can make life better for others through little acts of kindness which will help to build a caring community.  |
