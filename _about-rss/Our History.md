**Red Swastika School's History**

![](/images/RSS%20history.jpeg)
Red Swastika School was founded by the World Red Swastika Society (Singapore Administration Centre). As an extension of its charitable mandate and to achieve the noble objective of transforming people through education, the Society built a school on site at Somapah Road in Changi. The more-than-three-acres piece of land was donated by then President of the Society, Mr Quek Shin, who saw the need to provide free primary education for the poor and to aid in the promotion of education in the outlying areas. Originally known as “Wan Tzu School”, the school was later renamed Red Swastika School. The foundation stone was laid at the school opening ceremony on 13th January 1951.

He continued to expand the infrastructure and develop other programmes to meet the demands of the evolving educational curriculum. Good progress was seen over the years and that led to the school being selected as one of the six primary schools to pilot the use of both Chinese and English as the main medium of instruction in 1987. In 1990, it became a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School.|

A new three-storey extension building was completed in 1997, with a large hall, a three-storey building, a resource library, advance computer laboratories and a comfortable staff room. While maintaining academic excellence, the school strengthened the development of good character in students and also promoted the use of Information Technology in teaching and learning. As the school population grew, the school recognised the need to improve communication with parents and also to strengthen ties with former students. This led to the formation of the RSS Parent-Teacher Association in 1997 and the Alumni Association in 1998 |
